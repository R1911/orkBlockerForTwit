# orkBlockerForTwit
Twitter's built-in 'mute' or 'block' feature is limited in that it doesn't allow you to block specific symbols, emojis, or keywords **in usernames or display names**; it only targets keywords within the content of tweets. 

This simple browser extension exists to address this limitation, it allows filtering out users based on a specified filtering criteria.

The extension operates seamlessly without requiring login credentials or interaction with Twitter's API and only stores matching usernames in the browser cache. 
In essence it simply hides the tweets by users matching your specified filters directly in client-side rendering, in a similar manner Twitter's own functions appear, ensuring a cleaner and more tailored browsing experience.

## TODO
- Implement filtering for keywords within tweet content
  - why: Enhance functionality to include muting of specific keywords or URLs and support for wildcard characters within tweet content, which are not currently supported by Twitterâ€™s built-in mute feature.
