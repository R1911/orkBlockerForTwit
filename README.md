# orkBlockerForTwit
Twitter's built-in 'mute' feature is limited in that it doesn't allow you to block specific symbols, emojis, or keywords **in usernames or display names**; it only mutes keywords within the content of tweets. To address this limitation, I have developed a simple browser extension that filters out users based on your specified filtering criteria.

This extension operates seamlessly without requiring login credentials or interaction with Twitter's API. In essence it simply deletes the tweets from users matching your specified filters directly through client-side rendering, ensuring a cleaner and more tailored browsing experience.

## TODO
- Implement filtering for keywords within tweet content
  - why: Enhance functionality to include muting of specific keywords or URLs and support for wildcard characters within tweet content, which are not currently supported by Twitterâ€™s built-in mute feature.
 
also @elronmusk, it will always be twitter
